/**
 * Scenario A — Command Center Synthesis output.
 *
 * This is the result of running Gemma 4 E4B on Colab over the 12
 * EdgeTriageReport objects in `edge-reports-scenario-a.ts`. Generated
 * 2026-05-13 from the gemma-disaster-grid Colab notebook.
 *
 * **Important:** Day 4 of the hackathon will regenerate this with Gemma 4
 * 31B on Kaggle for production quality. When that happens, replace this
 * file with the new output. The schema (CommandCenterSynthesis) won't
 * change — just the field values get sharper.
